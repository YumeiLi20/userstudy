<h1>Instructions</h1>
<p>Hello, for the next while you will be completing some trials.</p>

<h2>What are these trials?</h2>
<p>Your goal is to click as many <mark id="red">red</mark> dots as possible, once a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot is clicked a new one will pop up somewhere on the screen.  You must click as many dots as you can within 5-10 seconds.  After that 5-10 seconds you will be prompted with a screen where you will click the boxed number representing how many <mark id="blue">blue</mark> squares you saw on the screen. </p>

<h2>How do I tell what's what?</h2>
<p>Your cursor is a crosshair that moves with your mouse, whenever your crosshairs is over a dot/square that dot/square will turn <mark id="green">green</mark> even if it's the <mark id="red">red</mark> dot, so be sure to click it even if it is no longer <mark id="red">red</mark>!</p>

<h2>How do these techniques work?</h2>
<p> Each technique has a different freeze region, except when you must use no technique or freezing the whole screen.  When you hit 'Shift' the dots/squares inside the highlighted region displayed on screen will freeze, expect for freezing the whole screen which has no highlighted region (freezes whole screen on freeze).  The techniques will be explained below. <p>
<p>NOTE: Once a <mark id="red">red</mark> dot is frozen and it's original goes off screen you will only have 2 seconds to click it.</p>

<h2>Will I be able to test the techniques before using them?</h2>
<p>Of course! Before using any new technique/trail combination you will be allowed practice.  You may practice as much as you want and during you will be told how many <mark id="blue">blue</mark> squares you guessed correctly!</p>
<p>NOTE: Practice at least 4 times so you can get an idea of the various speed/density combinations you will encounter with each technique/trail combination!</p>

<h1>Techniques</h1>
