Study of Record Linkage and Information Disclosure.
================
# Howto
## Environment Requirements

  Node.js (>=4.5.0)

  Express (>=4.14.0)

  Redis-server (>=0.0.3)

## Start
Open a cmd or terminal window (depends on you operating system), go to the project directory.

Before starting the app, first start a local redis server:
```sh
redis-server local.conf
```
or use an online redis server:
```sh
redis-server redis.conf
```
To start this app:
```sh
node app.js
```
## Url Parameters
There are a number of parameters that you can use to control the application. In addition to the url already present, adding the following will affect the app behaviour. To use multiple parameters in conjunction, use & to separate the parameters. For instance,
[https://ppirldev.herokuapp.com/?mode=2&section=4&testing=true](https://ppirldev.herokuapp.com/?mode=2&section=4&testing=true)

1. **Mode of disclosure:**

> /?mode=3

This is a compulsory parameter without which the website won't work. Takes any value from 1 to 5. 

2. **ID:**

> /?id=123

User supplied ID will be added to the data. Handy when user needs to be linked with other data. 

3. **Data for display:**
By default, the data present in output.csv will be displayed in the main section. This data can be controlled by using 
> /upload

and uploading the data there. 
However, if you want one of the predefined datasets chosen at random (that also give the recap slides meaning) use
> /?sampling=true

4. **Testing mode:**
By default, many pages force user input. To bypass this behaviour, use
> /?testing=true

5. **Skip to section:**
If you want to skip directly to a section there you can use,
> /?section=7

Please note that the section numbers are absolute whatever mode the user is using. Some important sections currently are :

* 3 - RL introduction
* 4 - Practice 1
* 5 - Data Mapping for modes 3 to 5
* 6 - Practice 2
* 8 - Main Study
* 9 - Section 2
* 10 - Post Questionnaire
